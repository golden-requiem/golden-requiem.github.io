I've mentioned that I've moved a lot but where exactly? I first came to the States 
after my father in 2015 to LA. I lived there for around 4 months and moved to the
Bay Area to complete 7th half of 8th grade. Then we relocated up north to Sacramento
where I compeletd 8th and most of 9th. During the end of 9th grade, we moved to 
Florida and then to Maryland where I currently live. There's a lot that I've learned 
moving around and I've met some amazing people.
