It's a sport I've partaken in since I was 6 and recently I've come
to love it more than anything. Even though its not a very
popular sport in the States, trough thick and thin
if there's anything that has lifted me up, it has to be 
cricket. There was a time when I wanted to play professionally
and while that hasn't been possible for me yet, its a 
sport that I enjoy a lot.
