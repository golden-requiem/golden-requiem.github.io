Since moving to the States at the age of 12 from India, I've moved around
a lot from middle school to middle school and high school to
high school. I plan to finish my Bachelors in Computer 
Science in 2025 and then go on do a Masters with a 
focus on Aritficial Intelligence and Machine Learning at the
University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I am always facinated by 
machine learning models that seems to mimic human intelligence while engaging in 
complex computations and predicting events far into the future which the average human 
would not even dream of attempting. Though the future of AI and its ability to replace 
humans is a little concerning it is still very intruiging to learn more about it and our
brains at the same time.

I've chosen to pursue my career in the field of Computer Science however, that is not 
my only interest. Philosphy and its many questions are always lead me into a rabbit hole
of existential questions. Mythology and Religion never cease to amaze me the way we 
used to think about the world centuries and millenia ago. I could go on and on but 
let's just say I like learning about a lot of things.

TL;DR 
Anything that interests me I like.
